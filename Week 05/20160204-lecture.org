* Another interval scheduling problem
We are given a set of intervals as before but they all have the same
start time.  Each task has a deadline.  Partial tasks are not
allowed. Our goal is that we want to schedule all the tasks and meet
all the deadlines. We can go past the deadline but we will be
penalized. The penalty is linear to how late the tasks take to finish.
No matter how early you finish your tasks before their deadlines,
their is no benefit for finishing them on time.

There is always a solution with no space between intervals. Proof was
done by contradiction.

/There is always one in-order solutions in the case where deadlines are
all unique/. We will prove this by contradiction...
