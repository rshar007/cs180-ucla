## Stable matching problem<a id="sec-1-1" name="sec-1-1"></a>

Kleinberg and Tardos begin their book by introducing us to the
*stable matching problem*. This problem is best summarized by the 
situations it may be used in: a college is trying to choose the best
students from its candidate pool, while maintaining stability. As
Kleinberg and Tardos introduce it, they want a self-enforcing
system.
