* Element uniqueness
** Algorithmic transformation
Consider a problem A,  and a set of integers \{ 2, 4,  9, 2, 3, 18 \};
is every element in  the set unique? One way to  solve this problem is
to sort the  numbers and check if  the sorted list. The  book uses the
notation A  \leq B  to show  that a  problem A  is transformed  into a
problem B. Formally, we say that a  problem A \leq_{p} B can be solved
in polynomial time if B can be  solved in polynomial time. If A cannot
be solved  in polynomial time, then  B cannot be solved  in polynomial
time.
* Clique problem revisited
A clique is a subset of vertices such that every vertex is connected
to each other.
